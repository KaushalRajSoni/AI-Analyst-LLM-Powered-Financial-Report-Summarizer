AI Analyst is a Python-based tool that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract and summarize key information from PDF financial reports. It combines text extraction with OpenAI-compatible language models (e.g., GPT-2) to answer user-defined questions over document chunks. The project is particularly useful for automating insights generation from corporate financial filings and investor reports.

Core Features:
Extracts full text from PDF reports using PyMuPDF.
Splits content into manageable chunks for efficient processing.
Answers custom queries using a pretrained LLM (gpt2-medium).
Modular design for easy adaptation to other domains beyond finance.

Result: Successfully extracted and summarized key financial highlights from the Reliance Industries Integrated Annual Report 2023â€“24 using GPT-2. The tool was able to provide interpretable insights by processing the first few document sections, validating its applicability for early-stage financial analysis automation.
